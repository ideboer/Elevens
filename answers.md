Buggy1:
    Constructor or Method: isEmpty()
    A possible error is if the body of the method was 
        return size != 0;
    or
        return size < 0;
    This would mean that the method returns false when the deck is empty, which is what the error is.

Buggy2:
    Constructor or Method: constructor
    A possible error is is the line
        size = cards.size();
    came before 
        for (int j = 0; j < ranks.length; j++) {
			for (String suitString : suits) {
				cards.add(new Card(ranks[j], suitString, values[j]));
			}
		}
    This would mean the starting size is zero, because no cards had yet been added to the deck. Another possible error is if in
        for (int j = 0; j < ranks.length; j++) {
			for (String suitString : suits) {
				cards.add(new Card(ranks[j], suitString, values[j]));
			}
		}
    the 0 was exchanged for a 1. In a one card deck, it would mean the loop never ran. No cards would be added to the deck, and the size would be zero.

Buggy3:
    Constructor or Method: shuffle()
    A possible error is if in
        for (int k = cards.size() - 1; k >= 0; k--) {
    the >= was replaced by <. This would mean the loop never ran, which means the decks would not be shuffled. So, the sequence would remain the same in each deck.

Buggy4:
    Constructor or Method: isEmpty() || constructor || deal()
    A possible error is that if isEmpty() returns true when it is not empty. This could happen if the == was replaced with a != in the function. Another possible error is is the size is one less than is should be. This could happen in either of the instances described in the possible errors for Buggy2. An error in any of these ways would mean that the deal function returns null when there is one card in a deck. Another possible error is if 
        size--;
    is above
        if (isEmpty()) {
			return null;
		}
    in deal(). This would mean the size goes down to zero. isEmpty() would be true, and it would return null when there sould be one card.
