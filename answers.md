1) 5 of spades and 6 of clubs
   5 of clubs and 6 of clubs
2) Yes. If there are three cards left, this means an odd number of cards has been pulled. The only way for this to happen is if an odd number of king/queen/jack combos has been pulled, because an even number would mean an even number of cards has been pulled.The decck is empty, so three of these combos must have been pulled, meaning there are is one more of these left. These are the three left on the table.
3) The game does not involve any strategy. No matter what pair you pull, the next cards will come up in the same order. Each number (or ace) can only pair with one other number (or ace). The face cards can only be in a combo with themselves. So, when more than one play is possible, it doesn't matter what you do because the plays will happen eventually either way.
